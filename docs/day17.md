* TCK (Test Clock) â€“ this signal synchronizes the internal state machine operations.
TMS (Test Mode Select) â€“ this signal is sampled at the rising edge of TCK to determine the next state.
* TDI (Test Data In) â€“ this signal represents the data shifted into the deviceâ€™s test or programming logic. It is sampled at the rising edge of TCK when the internal state machine is in the correct state.
* TDO (Test Data Out) â€“ this signal represents the data shifted out of the deviceâ€™s test or programming logic and is valid on the falling edge of TCK when the internal state machine is in the correct state.
* TRST (Test Reset) â€“ this is an optional pin which, when available, can reset the TAP controllerâ€™s state machine.
